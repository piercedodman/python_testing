## Introduction

As a Python enthusiast, I love exploring different aspects of the language and building small projects to enhance my skills. This repository is a showcase of some of my journey and the various scripts and programs I've created along the way.

Please note that the commit messages in this repository might not always be well-organized or follow best practices. The primary focus is on the code itself and the learning experience behind each project.

## Projects

### Command Line Blackjack
This project is a script that allows you to play the classic game of Blackjack right in your command line interface. It provides an interactive and enjoyable experience, implementing the basic rules of the game.

### Birthday Problem Simulator
The Birthday Problem Simulator is a program that runs simulations to demonstrate the famous birthday problem in probability theory. It calculates the probability of two or more people sharing the same birthday in a group of a given size.

### ASCII World Map Generator
This project is a command-line tool that generates an ASCII art representation of the world map. It takes text input provided by the user and creates a visually appealing map using ASCII characters.

Feel free to explore the individual project directories to learn more about each one and how to use them.

## Usage

To run any of the projects in this repository, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Each project directory should contain its own `README` file with specific instructions on how to set up and run the project.
